# connect_four_ai

This is an implementation of the Minimax algorithm for the classic game, connect 4. Alpha-beta pruning is used to improve runtime efficiency.

## Heuristic

This algorithm uses a basic heuristic which can be easily changed in ```helper_functions.py```. Currently it uses a simple score system based on how many possible 4s can be made.

## Board parameters

You can change the parameters of the board by changing the constants in ```ConnectFourBoard.py```
